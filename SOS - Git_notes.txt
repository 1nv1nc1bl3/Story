Initialization
--------------

1. We change to the directory we desire

2. We type 'git init' in Terminal. A '.git' folder is created. It is hidden and we can see it if we type 'ls -a' in Terminal. The folder that the '.git' folder resides, is called 'the working directory'.


Tracking changes to files
-------------------------

'Staging area'
The intermediate place between the working directory and the online repository. If no previous 'add' has been performed, all files in the directory will be named 'untracked' if we type a 'git status' order in Terminal.
