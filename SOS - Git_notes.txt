Initialization
--------------

1. We change to the directory we desire

2. We type 'git init' in Terminal. A '.git' folder is created. 
It is hidden and we can see it if we type 'ls -a' in Terminal. 
The folder that the '.git' folder resides, is called 'the working directory'.


Tracking changes to files
-------------------------

'Staging area' is the intermediate place between the working directory and the local repository. 
If no previous 'add' has been performed, all files in the directory will be named 'untracked' if we type a 'git status' order in Terminal. Then the files are ready to be 'commited'.


Committing changes
------------------

we type <git commit -m 'asdjkdkjadj'> where the string is an important thing because it describes the changes that have been made before the file(s) is/are committed to the repository. It is preferred to be in present tense.


Logging changes
---------------

we type 'git log' to see a log with all the commits we have performed.
